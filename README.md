# Welcome to Bierlund!

 Getting started

Start by playing the game.  At this point there is a tutorial and a starting
room called "Sandbox".  Get familiar with those first.

Second get into "building" that means creating new rooms and objects and
writing their descriptions. Building offers limitless opportunity for 
creativity.

Later you may wish to begin "developing".  Maybe you simply want to learn to 
code enough to enhance your building project, or maybe you want to
fundamentally alter the way this mud works. Developing in Bierlund involves 
learning about the game engine Evennia and about the Python programming
language.
